## Overview
**The "So What":** Standard pricing models were too slow for high-frequency environments. This project implements a C++ accelerated pricer that handles 10,000 options/sec.

## 1. The Problem
**Context:** Briefly explain *why* this matters.  
*Example:* "Standard Monte Carlo simulations are too slow for real-time pricing..."

## 2. The Solution
**Approach:** High-level summary of your strategy.
* **Metric:** What did you optimize? (Speed, Accuracy, Sharpe Ratio)
* **Tech Stack:** Python (NumPy, Pandas), C++, Docker.

## 3. Technical Implementation

::: {.callout-note}
### Key Algorithm: Vectorization
By replacing the `for` loop with NumPy vectorization, we reduced execution time from 40s to 0.2s.

## 4. Results
* **Performance:** 50x speedup.
* **Impact:** Enables real-time strategy backtesting.
