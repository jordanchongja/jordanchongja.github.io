## Definition
The Heston model assumes that volatility itself is a stochastic process. The dynamics are given by the SDEs:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_t^S
$$
$$
dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \xi \sqrt{v_t} dW_t^v
$$

Where:
* $\kappa$: Mean reversion speed
* $\theta$: Long-run variance

## Calibration Strategy
To calibrate this to the S&P 500 smile, we minimize the squared error between model price $C_{model}$ and market price $C_{market}$:

$$
\min_{\Theta} \sum_{i} (C_{model}(K_i, T_i) - C_{market}(K_i, T_i))^2
$$

## Implementation Details
I implemented the pricing using the Fourier Transform method (Lewis, 2001) because it allows for semi-closed form solutions, which are significantly faster than Monte Carlo for calibration purposes.
